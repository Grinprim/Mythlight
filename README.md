# Mythlight RPG System

Mythlight is a narrative-focused roleplaying game designed for simplicity and fluid storytelling. It abandons complex polyhedral dice sets in favor of a straightforward 2d6 engine, ensuring that rules never get in the way of a great moment.

This repository hosts the web-based System Reference Document (SRD) for Mythlight, providing an interactive and accessible way to browse rules, traits, and spells.

## System Overview
### Core Philosophy:
- Narrative First: Combat and checks are designed to be fast, using as few rolls as possible to keep the story moving.
- Classless Progression: There are no classes or experience levels (XP). Progression is milestone-based, where characters grow by acquiring Traits and increasing Attributes.
- Open Setting: The ruleset is flexible, supporting both high fantasy and low fantasy campaigns.

### The Engine
The core mechanic is simple:
- **2d6 + Attribute Score + Skill Modifier** vs **Challenge Score (CS)**
- **Midnight** (Critical Success): Rolling two natural 6s. Results in double damage and automatic success.
- Snake Eyes (Critical Failure): Rolling two natural 1s. Results in automatic failure and complications.

## Attributes
### Characters are defined by four simple stats:
- **Physique**: Raw strength, agility, and physical endurance (Skills: Might, Athletics, Fortitude, Brawn).
- **Mystique**: Magical knowledge, control, and potency (Skills: Arcana, Insight, Scholarship, Spellcraft).
- **Technique**: Engineering, tinkering, and fine manual skill (Skills: Tinkering, Finesse, Aim, Reflex).
- **Charm**: Social influence. Unlike other stats, Charm is dynamic—it starts at 0 and fluctuates based on your in-game social successes and failures.

## Combat Mechanics
### Combat is structured into Scenes (approx. 6 seconds):
- **Turn Order**: Determined dynamically by player declaration or "word of mouth."
- **Action Economy**: Every turn grants 2 Actions (Attack, Move, Cast, etc.) and 1 Reaction per scene.
- **Health & Guard**: Damage is taken to Guard (temporary defense) first, then Health. Reaching 0 Health results in unconsciousness.

## Getting Started
### To use these rules for your game, you only need:
- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) per player.
- A Character Sheet (to track Stats, Inventory, and Traits).
- One Narrator to guide the story.
